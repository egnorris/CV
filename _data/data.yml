    title: About
    summary: |
         Evan Norris is a Ph.D. student in the Department of Physics at the University of Ottawa. His research primarily focuses on the 
         solution of inverse problems using computational physics. his current work includes the development of a deep learning system 
         for the prediction of scattered fields by arbitrarily shaped plasmonic nanoparticles and a computational microscopy framework 
         for orientation imaging of collagen fibrils using second harmonic generation microscopy without interferometry. In the future his 
         primary research directions include the application of deep learning algorithms for the solution of inverse problems and the further 
         development of computational phase reconstruction systems.
